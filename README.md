Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The requirements for this application were that we needed to create an applicaiton the included a login/register acount screen as well as include the funtionality of adding to and editing a database for display to the user. In this instance, the goal was to track weights of a user in order to assist them in reaching some goal weight. The user needed a login screen to keep their information protected. Also, since this is a more simple application, the user was kept in moind by not overcomplicating the UI/features. 


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I took a dynamic approach to creating my application in the sense that I essentially tested as I coded. I believe that the inclusion of an emulator is very helpful in this regard. In the future, this will be very helpful, especially when it comes to creating some more complex applications where we need to test to ensure that certain functions play well on other screens and with other functions. 


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Again, the emulator was a great help. Not only did it allow my development to be far more simple, but it also put me in the shoes of the consumer and allowed me to tweak things that needed to be corrected, especially when it came to the UI aesthetic. 


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Innovation was certainly required when it came to combining all of the different activities. Otherwise, I found development to be fairly simple and able to be corrected as I went along. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe that I was particularly successful when it came to the login screen. Being my first UI that I have ever made, I was nervous but I overcame that and created something that I am proud of.
